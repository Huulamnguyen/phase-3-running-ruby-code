# ** Outputting Strings with puts and print
puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello World!"

# print "Hello World!"
# print "Hello World!"
# print "Hello World!"

print "Pass this test, please."


# ** Inspecting Data with p and pp
# This is the equivalent of calling:
# puts [1, 2, 3].inspect
p [1, 2, 3]

# Ruby has one more method, pp, for "pretty-printing" complex data, 
# such as nested arrays and hashes (the Ruby equivalent of a JavaScript object):
pp [{ id: 1, hello: "World" }, { id: 2, hello: "Ruby" }, { id: 3, hello: "Moon" }, { id: 4, hello: "Learner" }]
